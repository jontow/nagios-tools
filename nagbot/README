This robot should be run on the nagios server itself, with readable
permissions set on the nagios logfile.  It'll join a channel, by
default '#nagios', and start spewing crap at you in near real-time.

It doesn't do a lot of preprocessing or parsing, but all of that can
be modified in 'nlog.rb'.



To configure the robot, copy "EXAMPLE-config.rb" to "config.rb",
modify parameters as necessary.  There is hopefully no useful
configuration change to make outside of this file.  I could be wrong.
