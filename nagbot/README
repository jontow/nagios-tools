This robot should be run on the nagios server itself, with readable
permissions set on the nagios logfile.  It'll join a channel, by
default '#nagios', and start spewing crap at you in near real-time.

It doesn't do a lot of preprocessing or parsing, but all of that can
be modified in 'nlog.rb'.



To configure the robot, edit start_bot.rb: modify 'bot.open()' line:
  bot.open('ircserver.com', ['username', 'realname'], 'nickname')

You may also need to change the IRC channel and the nagios logfile
location: see IRCBot.initialize "@channel" variable in 'main.rb',
and 'NAGIOSLOG' in 'nlog.rb'.  Yeah, yeah, dirty, I know.  I'll
clean it up at some point and move all of this out into a config file!
